# Playing with Array.observe / Object.observe

Use the [Array.observe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/observe) or [Object.observe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe) API to implement a simple TODO app. Your todos can be stored in an array, and when items are added or removed, you should update the UI.

Note that latest Chrome supports `Object.observe` and `Array.observe`, but many browsers do not.
