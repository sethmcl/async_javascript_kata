# Write your own event emitter

Node.js provides an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) class for adding pub/sub functionality to your objects. In this exercise, we are going to implement our own object for registering and firing events.

There is a test suite included that you can run to measure your progress. To complete the assignment, ensure all tests pass.

## Setup

Ensure you have Node.js installed.

## Running the test suite

Simply execute `make test` from the project directory to run the tests.
